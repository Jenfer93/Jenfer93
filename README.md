# Hello! 

So happy to see you here :v:

### My name is Jenny from Norway! 
I am currently studying to become a Front-End Developer. 

Languages I've learn this far: 

- HTML 
- CSS
- JavaScript

I'm also passionated towards the design part of my studies and prefer a clean design with a lot of focus on KISS (keep it simple, stupid).
