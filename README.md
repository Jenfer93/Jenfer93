# Hello! 

So happy to see you here :v:

### My name is Jenny, and I'm from Norway! 
I am currently studying to become a Front-End Developer at
[Noroff - School of Technology and Digital Media](https://www.noroff.no/). 

While studing I work part-time as the salesmanager at [Nermo hotel](https://nermohotell.no/) in Ã˜yer. 

**Languages I've learned this far:** 

- HTML 
- CSS
- JavaScript

I also love to design and in most of my design I focus on KISS (keep it simple, stupid). And always keeps the UI and UX in mind when creating applications. 
If you want to have a look at some of my work you will find my portfolio here: [My portfolio](https://quiet-faun-9d78e7.netlify.app/).:raising_hand:
