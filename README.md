# Hello! 

So happy to see you here :v:

### My name is Jenny, and I'm from Norway! 
I am currently studying to become a Front-End Developer. 

Languages I've learned this far: 

- HTML 
- CSS
- JavaScript

I also love to design and in most of my design I focus on KISS (keep it simple, stupid). And always keeps the UI and UX in mind when creating applications. 
If you want to have a look at some of my work you will find my portfolio here: [My portfolio]().:raising_hand:

And if you want to connect with me on social media you can find me on [My LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenny-marie-feragen-2a9a3a108/) :satellite:
